Overview
========

The S0ix Power Mode Transition Driver is a Linux kernel module that provides detailed monitoring and statistics collection for system power management events, with a particular focus on S0ix (Modern Standby) power states.

What is S0ix?
-------------

S0ix, also known as "Modern Standby" or "Connected Standby," is a low-power idle state that allows systems to maintain network connectivity while consuming minimal power. Unlike traditional suspend-to-RAM (S3), S0ix enables:

- Instant wake-up capabilities
- Background app refresh and notifications
- Maintenance of network connections
- Reduced power consumption while "sleeping"

Features
--------

The S0ix Driver provides the following capabilities:

Real-time Power Event Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module monitors and records various power management events:

- ``PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE`` - System preparing for suspend
- ``PM_POST_SUSPEND`` - System resuming from suspend  
- ``PM_HIBERNATION_PREPARE`` - System preparing for hibernation
- ``PM_POST_HIBERNATION`` - System resuming from hibernation
- ``PM_RESTORE_PREPARE`` - System preparing for restore
- ``PM_POST_RESTORE`` - System restored

Statistics Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Total suspend/resume cycle counts
- Duration measurements for each suspend cycle
- Average suspend time calculations
- Cumulative time spent in suspend states

Multiple Interface Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver provides data access through multiple interfaces:

- **Proc filesystem** (``/proc/s0ix_stats``) - Human-readable statistics
- **Sysfs attributes** - Individual statistics for programmatic access
- **Kernel log messages** - Real-time event logging via ``dmesg``

Architecture
------------

The S0ix Driver is implemented as a Linux kernel module that integrates with the kernel's power management subsystem through several key components:

Platform Driver Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module registers as a platform driver to receive power management callbacks:

- Suspend callback: Records suspend initiation and timestamps
- Resume callback: Calculates suspend duration and updates statistics

Power Management Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Registers with the kernel's power management notifier chain
- Receives notifications for all major power state transitions  
- Maintains thread-safe access to statistics using mutex synchronization

Data Storage and Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Thread-safe statistics structure with mutex protection
- Proc filesystem entry for human-readable output
- Sysfs attribute group for programmatic access
- High-precision timing using kernel time APIs

Use Cases
---------

This driver is particularly useful for:

Development and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Debugging power management issues
- Validating suspend/resume functionality
- Performance analysis of power state transitions
- System integration testing

System Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Long-term power usage analysis
- Identifying abnormal suspend/resume patterns
- Collecting metrics for power optimization

Educational Purposes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Understanding Linux power management subsystems
- Learning kernel module development techniques
- Exploring platform driver implementation patterns

Limitations
-----------

Please note the following limitations:

- **GPL Kernel Compatibility**: While the project uses BSD 3-Clause License, the kernel module must be GPL-compatible when loaded
- **Kernel Version Dependency**: Must be built for the specific kernel version in use  
- **Platform Support**: Primarily designed for x86 systems with S0ix support
- **Development Focus**: Intended for educational and development use rather than production deployment

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

The S0ix Driver is designed to have minimal impact on system performance:

- **Low Memory Footprint**: Uses efficient data structures with minimal memory allocation
- **Fast Execution**: Suspend/resume callbacks execute quickly to avoid impacting power transitions
- **Thread Safety**: Proper mutex usage ensures safe concurrent access without blocking
- **Efficient Logging**: Selective kernel message logging to avoid log spam
